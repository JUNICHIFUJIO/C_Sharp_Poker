Scenario:
-- Have a two pair
-- Have 5000 dollars
-- very confident i can win
-- bet is ante (20)

-- i would bet anywhere from 30 (to test people) to about 300 if I wanted to force the hands of everyone 
-- raise to 50

Scenario:
-- two pair
-- have 5000 dollars
-- very confident
-- bet is 200 (2 people raised, one folded)

-- i would raise to 300 to make it known i'm confident about my hand (very little chance of someone having a stronger hand (5%?))


Scenario:
-- one pair
-- have 300 dollars
-- not really confident
-- bet is ante

-- i would raise from 30 to 50 depending on the value of the pair

Scenario:
-- one pair
-- have 5000 dollars
-- not really confident
-- doesn't change much unless i have a ton of money

-- i would raise to 30 to 60 dollars

Scenario:
-- straight
-- have 1000 dollars
-- fully confident i'll win
-- doesn't change
-- ante

-- i would raise from ante to 80
-- i would raise from raised amount of 200 to 350 or call (to wring out more money from people)
-- i would raise from raised amount of 1000 to 1100

Scenario:
-- high card
-- have x money
-- no confidence
-- stay in on ante, fold on everything else

Scenario:
-- three of a kind
-- have 1000 dollars
-- ante: 70 dollars
-- raised to 200: 250

Scenario:
-- four of a kind
-- have 3000
-- ante: 100 dollars (second round) (or 50 if wringing people dry)
--raised to 300: 400

***
full house and above you can wring people dry in the first round
// aka bet lower than you would normally, let people continue raising, then see how things pan out 
// for the second round after discards are done







There is an innate calculable value for each and every single hand.
However, the value of the hand is entirely dependent upon
	-- current money held	
	-- potential loss
	-- potential gain
	-- chances of the hand being beaten by another player

The value of the hand is a multiplier that is applied to some base value.
This multiplier multiplied by the base value means that 

1) Calculate the base value
2) Adjust the value based on the amount of money currently in the pot
3) Determine if the value of the card is sufficient to continue gambling
4) 

Indicates that there is some maximum value that people are willing to bet
before they refuse to bet anymore. This MAX_VALUE should be dependent on the
amount of money they have before hand. Once an individual has gone all in,
they do not have to consider this MAX_VALUE anymore.

The MAX_VALUE is also dependent upon how easily other people can reach this
value. If one individual is able to bet up to 100 k, while everyone else is
able to bet up to 20 k, the first individual is not going to bet all 100 k
in any circumstance. He will bet at most 20 k.

This indicates that MAX_VALUE is dependent upon a set of weighted values
dependent upon each individual's available funds, and is entirely dynamic in
nature.

In addition, MAX_VALUE is also affected by the value of one's hand. If possessing
a particularly powerful hand, or one that is very very likely to win, given the
remainder of the cards, MAX_VALUE may fluctuate one way or the other.

Scenarios:
1) 10 k, 10k, 10k : 100 k
2) 30 k, 24 k, 12 k, : 20 k
3) 15 k, 25 k, 25 k : 8 k
4) 5 k, 5 k, 5 k : 5 k

Critical maximum, tends to be 80%
--> Maximum derived then from the current bet, which may be up to 1.32x
	the current bet as long as it does not exceed the critical maximum.

--> If the estimated value greatly exceeds ( > 2.5x) the current bet, will
make a bid to raise
--> If estimated value somewhat exceeds the current bet, or is close,
will estimate the chances to win, and from there decides whether to call
or to raise or to fold (if value greatly lower
